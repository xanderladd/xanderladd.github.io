## Population Simulator

**What is population simulator?**

Based on [this youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM&ab_channel=Primer), my friend Jay Kakkar and I built this side project over the pandemic. The main idea is that there is a population and they eat things in order to evolve and survive. We used this project as a refresher for a lot of the key concepts we've learned throughout the years such as breadth-first search (BFS), depth first search (DFS), A* search algorithm and object oriented design in Java. It's also a nice way to learn user interface in Java. There are an overwhelming amount of directions for this project given natural links to AI and genetic programming. As I've been a little swamped with getting into grad school, we've put this on pause. But, below there is an example of a very large random population foraging.
