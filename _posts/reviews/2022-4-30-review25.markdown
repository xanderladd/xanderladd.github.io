Silversmith, Daniel B., et al. "Plug-and-play control of a brain–computer interface through neural map stabilization." Nature Biotechnology 39.3 (2021): 326-335.

- Having recently read higher level overviews of BCIs, reading this paper in Nature Biotech will be especially relevant but more specfic.
- Abstract
    - 180 channel electrocorticography (ECoG) implant in a paralyzed individual enabled stable monitoring of signals.
    - Long term closed loop adaptataion updates decoder weights over several days, thus updating map and plug and play control.
Intro
    - Currently, 30 min daily recalibration results in variability in peformance and decreased decoding performance in the long-term.
    - ECoG PNP control achieved using interface that updates within session instead via closed loop decoder adaptation (CLDA) and potentially over longer terms (ltCDA).
Results
    - Fig. 1
        - ECoG signal comes from a few brain reigions: S1, M1 , PMC, PMV, SMA.
        - **Kalman Filter** decoder weights.
        - There are a few aspects that are clearly different between ltCLDA and daily initializaiton:
            - Time to taget increased, though it is hard to tell by how much as I can't see mean values in the intervals.
            - ITR shows clear increase during ltCDA.
            - Convergence of decoder weights is faster using ltCDA.
        - Time to target decreases from 18 to 6 seconds with tight error bounds.
        - I do not understand box diagram in fig H. Are the outwward pointing arrows for CNS and KF pipeline outputs?
    - Weights are general orthogonal at the start of each dailty initializaiton, so pooling weights over days hurt model performance.
    - ltCDA resulted in stable convergence of decoder weights across sessions instead.
    - Higher half life values (history length used in weight updates) led to better fixed control and more stable weight convergence.
    - Some weights exhibiting low magnitude or common trends may be redundant and enables sparseness.
    - Fig. 2
        - A lot more variance in decoder map weights for daily initialization method.
        - As the days go on, the orthoganlity of the weights seems to decrease.
        - mu weights decrease w/ linear trends and gamma2 weights increase w/ linear trend.
        - Sparsity / weight pruning is pretty shocking with the 25% of the weights verison having a very similar time to target.
    - Fig. 3
        - Daily calibration had higher circular sd across channels in preferred direction (PD) task.
        - Decoder weight magnitude correlated to circular SD of PD.
        - gamma2 weights are stable from day 36+ and it is visually confirmed. 
        - All weights show some trend toward stable convergence after day 18+, which is really interesting because it suggests long term improvment with ltCLDA method.
    - Fig. 4 
        - ltCDA to Fixed Decoder swap at day 206 + 28 recovery.
        - both ltCDA and CLDA after reset seem to have stable weights.
        - Decoder weights angle is rougly 45 degress after reset.
    Fig. 5
        - Point and click task where cursor path and bits per second information rate are tracked.
        - Weights seem much sparser for click map.
        - I wonder how they will look for less convergent features.
        - Neural state needs to cross click threshold.
        - Everyday, after cursor is in target area, stable clicking within 1 sec.
    - No significant drop in performance during PnP sessions (plug and play = no recalibration).
    - Decoder reinitialization had 45 degree weight angle change but then converge back to 0.
- Discussion
    - ltCDA is important example of weights being carried over a long time constant.
    - CLDA basd on coadaptation can rapidly allow skilled control.
    - Task related manifolds can be remarkably stable.
    - Results indicate feasibility of PnP.
