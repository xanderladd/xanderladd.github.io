- Neuropixels: high resolution brain recording from implanted electrodes.
- Until recently Neuropixel devices are only used on primates and rodents, but now they can be used in people thanks to Dr. Paulk and Dr. Cash at [Cashlab](https://cashlab.mgh.harvard.edu/people/).
- Neural recordings for brain computer interfaces are researched in clinical trials due to the risks associated with implantable electrodes.
- However further development of the decoding that can be performed at various resolutions helps inform new and more effective BCI.
- Short, fast, and simple tasks may help understand neural coding at a more basic level.
- Primary application is that the user would control a robotic arm or robotic device that responds to decoded brain activity.
- Utah microelectrode array as the leading measurement device for 7 years.
- RNN Decoder translates Neural activity from 200 neurons into characters at rate of 90 characters per minute.

>> Your brain is actually issuing more information per second when you handwrite than when you make a straight line. That increased complexity made it easier to quickly decode the intended letter â€” and offers new opportunities for exploring neural coding,"

- Dr. Pandarinath researchers fast finger movements, unlike commonly researched reaching and grasping movements.
- Dr. Stavisky and Dr. Shenoy are able to reliably deocde speech related neural activity from handknob area in people who can't move their hands but can still speak.
- Still the question of what machinery is used for what task is outstanding. It will be hard to map areas even between common tasks like walking and running.
- Lower dimension manifolds for interpreting neural recodings.
- Neuropixels code and data are public.
- Dr. Paulk says diversity of waveforms produced is a new and surprising result.
- There still exist significant engineering challenges around neuropixels, like how to stablize the device and transmit data.
