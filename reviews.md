## Reviews

Here I review some papers I read. I want to emphasize that I aim to keep reviews respectful of the authors work. I understand how hard it is to put research together and the last thing I want to do is have authors feeling like I put their work on blast. Especially, because I do not claim to be an expert in the exact domains of the papers I am reading. I am an early career researcher, a beginner whose goal is to learn. **I'd like to use this to celebrate / share work I think is awesome!**. And also to agglomerate notes on cool things. If you have concerns about a post, please email me at zladd@berkeley.edu.

Or leave a comment or give feedback --  I'd love to engage :)

Thanks and hope you all enjoy,

Xander
