# Projects

Everyone likes a good side project. But the real challenge with a side project is getting anything done. The fact of the matter is, these passion projects normally get the short end of the stick... and we wish they wouldn't. Here, I feature some of the ones I got the ball rolling on and even some of the ones I hope to undertake in the future.

## Future Project Ideas
   - One day I want to assemble my own GPU. I love lightning fast computing and I hope this would help me gain a deeper appreciation for the hardware that powers the amazing things computers can do.
