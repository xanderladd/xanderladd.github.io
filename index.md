## Bio
I am a machine learning researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. In 2020, I received my BA in Cognitive Science and Data Science from University of California, Berkeley and was a research assistant at Dr. Kevin Bender's lab (UCSF).

## Research Interests
I am interested in computational neuroscience, particularly as it relates to understand the circuit and network level dynamics that allow for the efficent coding of internal representations. I am fascinated by how such a noisy, distributed, and error prone network can a) self organize and b) learn how to make representations of visual scences and abstract concepts (two very different tasks) and c) quickly generalize between tasks. These kinds of questions, fused with my interest in problem solving have led me down the paths of active learning, bayesian stats, and software engineering, but never away from my main focus: Neuroscience.
